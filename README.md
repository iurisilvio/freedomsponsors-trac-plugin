freedomsponsors-trac-plugin

This is the FreedomSponsors "SponsorThis" plugin for Trac.

When installed, it will add a "Sponsor this" link in context navigation bar on your Trac's ticket view. The link leads to a FreedomSponsors page where the user can place a bounty for that ticket.

Similar functionality is also available for [JIRA](https://github.com/freedomsponsors/freedomsponsors-jira-plugin), [Bugzilla](https://github.com/freedomsponsors/freedomsponsors-bugzilla-plugin) and [Github](http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/freedomsponsors-github-integration/).
